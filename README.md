**Current Challenges and Coinbet&#39;s solution**

Coinbet addresses and eliminates many of these issues by introducing new, innovative approaches to online gambling infrastructure and utilizing leading blockchain technology.

- **Lack of System integration and compatibility**

Modern iGaming products and services have evolved over the past few decades and become highly sophisticated. As with the evolution of the internet, modern iGaming companies have built on developed web technologies. Blockchain technical is currently in its infancy, comparable with the internet in the mid 1990&#39;s when many of the concepts and capabilities of the early internet were limited to technologists and geeks or nerds.

- **Limited Market Access and Liquidity**

A significant limitation for the crypto gambling industry is the relatively limited market access to cryptocurrencies and the ability for ordinary players to easily convert from fiat money to crypto currencies. The relatively new crypto markets currently have a combined market cap of less than US$300 billion, with a significant proportion being held in exchanges. This means few large pools of liquidity currently exist in smaller industries such as gambling.

- **Transparency and trust**

One major concern with conventional online casinos is that data such as gaming results, winnings and payouts are intentionally hidden, concealed or manipulated by insiders or malicious third party actors, out of site from public scrutiny. Online fraud and hacking attacks on traditional online gambling services cause significant losses for the gambling industry, and also eroding the players confidence and trust. Online casinos have in the past been accused of using tricks and scams to steal funds and data from customers, as well as not disclosing the loss of funds by attackers.

Recent reports indicate that about 45% of financial institutions such as money transfers and stock exchanges suffer from economic crime annually. Online gambling sites, as centralized operators with centralized databases, are susceptible to cyber-attacks by online criminals because they represent a single point of failure, and once breached, offer a treasure trove of customer information and funds.

- **Provable Fairness**

It is well known that the &quot;House always wins&quot;. Gambling systems traditionally give the House an &quot;unfair advantage&quot;. However, in a programmatically deterministic system, the competitive edge of the House is reduced, when the probability and prize pool are encoded directly into the game. Coinbet will provide a platform to enable this provable fairness capability for all iGaming products built on top of the Coinbet ecosystem, and its blockchain-enabled platform. In addition, Coinbet has developed a certified Random Number Generator (RNG) which will be implemented on all games of chance on the platform.

- **Slow Payout, High fees**

Current real money online gambling operators rely heavily on the formal financial system, and institutions such as banks, financial institutions and credit card companies to act as on- and off-ramps. For the large number of unbanked or underbanked global population, they have limited options for accessing many online gambling services.

- **Global accessibility and Limited options**

The global nature of online gambling means that millions of transactions occur every day in different parts of the world. This is compounded by the fact that many countries and jurisdictions banning or making gambling illegal. This has driving many players, who have limited legal options, to participate in underground or illegal gambling markets. Interpol have estimated that the global illegal gambling market is valued up to US$1 trillion, with approximately 80 percent of the volume coming from the Asia Pacific region.
